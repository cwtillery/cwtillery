~ Hi, I'm Carson Tillery. 

~ In my spare time I like spending time with friends, playing video games, skating, making music, and sometimes I build PCs and keyboards.

~ I'm currently working on my Master's degree in Computer Science/Software Engineering at Auburn University and developing Hololens 2 applications with a professor at ICAMS.
